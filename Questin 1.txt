Question 1
A. What is an Algorithm? Algorithm are a set of instructions that are executed to get the solution to a given problem.
def fxn(*g):
    x=sum(g)
    y=len(g)
    z=x/y
    print(g)
    print(type(g))
    print(x,y,z)
fxn(23,67,89,10,34,11,23,45,8)

B. What is a psuedocode? Psuedocode is a way of expressing an algorithm without conforming to specific syntax rules.

C. What is a flowchart? A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process.

D. What are the properties of an algorithm?
(i) The inputs must be specified.
(ii) The outputs must be specified.
(iii) Definiteness.
(iv) Effectiveness.
(v) Finiteness.

E. Write an Algorithm to add two numbers together?
a=5
b=10
c="a + b"
print(c)

F. Begin
   Number s1, s2, sum
   Output("Input number 1:")
   Input s1
   Output("Input number 2:")
   Input s2
   sum=s1+s2
   Output sum
   End

G. Step 1: Start
   Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2, and sum.
   Step 3: Read values for num1, num2.
   Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to a variable sum.
   Step 5: Display sum
   Step 6: Stop
